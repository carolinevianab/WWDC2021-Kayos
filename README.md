## Description

**Kay**, or **Kayos** is an experience about chaos.

Kay always had a deep interest in chaos theory. Especially when she discovered the existence of strange attractors, areas where chaos would tend to evolve, no matter where it started. And that really got Kay's interest.

In this experience, you can see the 2D patterns created by 4 strange attractors: 
- Lorenz Attractor
- Aizawa Attractor
- Thomas Attractor
- Chua Attractor

You can watch any of this systems evolving in its own chaotic behaviour, dancing around the attractor.
